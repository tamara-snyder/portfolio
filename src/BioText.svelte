  <p class="about">
    Hi, I'm Tamara! I am an iOS developer with a passion for learning new things and building beautiful and functional apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    I come from a musical background — I received my Master of Music degree in bassoon performance from Yale in May of 2021, and I would like to think that I can even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC7UmLJI9Uk" target="_blank">play two instruments at the same time</a>.

    Currently, I work as a Junior iOS Developer at The Hershey Company, where I <strike>eat too much candy</strike> develop and maintain the company's internal iOS apps. In my spare time, you can find me contributing to open source projects like the <a href="https://www.hackforla.org/" target="_blank">Hack for LA</a> website or riding my gravel bike everywhere I possibly can.
