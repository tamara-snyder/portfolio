<p class="about">
  Hi there, I'm Tamara! I'm an iOS developer with a passion for learning new things and building apps that bring joy to my users.

<p class="about">
  Fun fact: I'm actually a classically-trained bassoonist â€” I've performed all over Europe and the US, but after taking a few computer science classes during my master's degree, I became hooked on programming. I dabbled in everything from C to Python to Ruby and JavaScript, but I finally landed on Swift and iOS when I realized how much I love designing for the mobile experience. And now here you are, browsing my development portfolio.

  Currently, I'm volunteering as a part of the website team at Hack for LA, where I improve the frontend and help orientate new members. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me with your project ideas!
