  <p class="about">
    Hi, I'm Tamara! I am a budding iOS developer with a passion for learning new things and building beautiful and functional mobile apps. I love programming in Swift and creating native iOS apps, as well as working on web projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    I come from a musical background as a classical bassoonist, and I would like to think that I can even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC7UmLJI9Uk" target="_blank">play two instruments at the same time</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my spare time, you can find me volunteering as a full-stack developer for the <a href="https://www.hackforla.org/" target="_blank">Hack for LA</a> website or riding my gravel bike everywhere I possibly can.
