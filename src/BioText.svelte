  <p class="about">
    Hi, I'm Tamara (rhymes with "camera") and I've been an iOS developer since 2022. I love working with the interactive nature of mobile platforms and am always learning new things.
  </p>
  <p>
    I come from a musical background — I received my Master of Music degree in bassoon performance from Yale in May of 2021, and I would like to think that I can even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC7UmLJI9Uk" target="_blank">play two instruments at the same time</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of my time as an iOS developer has been spent at The Hershey Company, where I <strike>ate too much candy</strike> developed and maintained the company's retail execution iOS apps, which were built using a mix of UIKit, SwiftUI, and legacy Objective-C code. In my spare time, you can find me running, cycling, or knitting my dream sweater.
