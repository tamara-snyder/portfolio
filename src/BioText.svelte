  <p class="about">
    Hi, I'm Tamara (rhymes with Camera)! I've been an iOS developer since 2022 and I love working with the lightweight, interactive nature of mobile platforms and am always learning new things.
  </p>
  <p>
    I come from a musical background as a classical bassoonist, and I would like to think that I can even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC7UmLJI9Uk" target="_blank">play two instruments at the same time</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am an iOS developer at The Hershey Company, where I <strike>eat too much candy</strike> develop and maintain the company's internal iOS apps. In my spare time, you can find me running with friends, cycling, or knitting my dream sweater.
