<p class="about">
  My background is in classical music (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ds25jUZGiS-Y35E1Eze9A">check me out on YouTube!</a>). I only discovered my passion for programming when I signed up for a data science class while I was pursuing my master's in bassoon performance at Yale.

<p class="about">
  Since then, I've dabbled in everything from Python to C to Ruby and JavaScript, but I finally landed on Swift and iOS when I realized how much I love designing for the mobile experience. And now here you are, browsing my portfolio.

<p class="about">
  Currently, I'm volunteering as a part of the website team at Hack for LA, where I work on issues like auditing the security of the site from Liquid injections, cleaning up the site's codebase, and helping onboard new members to our team. I am open to full-time work, so please don't hesitate to get in touch.
